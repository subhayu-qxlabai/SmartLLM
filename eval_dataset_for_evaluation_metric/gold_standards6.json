Babysit for people that you know or strangers. You can make an ad and put it up at your school or church. In your ad, write down what hours you are available and how much money you charge. Just make sure you know how to babysit before you start! If you live in an area where the paper is still delivered, you can become a paper boy (though you don't need to be a boy to do it!). Check with your local papers to find out if they have any openings. You can mow lawns, trim hedges, pull weeds, plant flowers, and do other yard work for people in your own neighborhood, for your parents, or for other people you know. Make a flyer and pass it out to people you know and ask them to pass it along if they don't need help. Just make sure you don't ask for too much money! Walking neighborhood dogs is another way you can make some fast money, especially if you end up walking dogs that get along well with other dogs because then you can walk more than one dog at a time! Put up fliers in your neighborhood or hand them out to your neighbors that you know own dogs. You can also tutor to earn money. Decide what you're good at and know a lot about and then make a flier with your hours and how much you want to charge. Put it up at your school or a lower school in the area.
