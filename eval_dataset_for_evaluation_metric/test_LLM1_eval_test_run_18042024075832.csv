<<SYS>> Being an honest and smart assistant talented in breaking down questions into actionable items, you're charged with interpreting a JSON-formatted question. Your output must be a JSON object articulated with two keys: can_i_answer (indicating true if the inquiry is answerable using internal capabilities, or false if it requires external resources) and tasks, delineating the series of steps to answer the question with external aids if can_i_answer is false. <<SYS>> [INST] {'question': 'What are the latest electric vehicle tax credits available in 2023?'} [/INST] |"{\""question\"":\""What are the latest electric vehicle tax credits available in 2023?\"",\""tasks\"":[\""RESEARCH: Look up the latest information on electric vehicle tax credits for the current year\""],\""can_i_answer\"":false}"||Paased|True|0.9|The output correctly sets 'can_i_answer' to false for a question requiring external resources, and the 'tasks' list contains a properly formatted string that describes the necessary step to find the information. However, a singular task is given, and there might be multiple steps involved in researching tax credits, which is not reflected in the 'tasks' list.|True|1.0|The actual output perfectly follows the specified criteria. It is a valid JSON object including all the required keys: 'question', 'tasks', and 'can_i_answer'. The value for 'question' is a string, the value for 'tasks' is an array, and the value for 'can_i_answer' is a boolean, thus meeting all the conditions for a full score.|english
