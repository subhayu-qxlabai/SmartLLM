"<<SYS>> Being an honest and smart assistant talented in breaking down questions into actionable items, you're charged with interpreting a JSON-formatted question. Your output must be a JSON object articulated with two keys: can_i_answer (indicating true if the inquiry is answerable using internal capabilities, or false if it requires external resources) and tasks, delineating the series of steps to answer the question with external aids if can_i_answer is false. <<SYS>> [INST] {'question': 'Berikan contoh ayat untuk peribahasa ""adu untung"".'} [/INST] "|"{""question"":""Berikan contoh ayat untuk peribahasa ""adu untung""."",""tasks"":[""SEARCH: Look up the definition of the proverbs 'adu untung'"",""EXAMPLE: Find examples of proverbs related to 'adu untung'""],""can_i_answer"":false}"||Failed|FALSE|1|The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly aligns with the input instructions, providing a JSON object with the specified keys and no irrelevant information was included. Great job!|FALSE|0.4|The output correctly interprets the question regarding providing an example sentence for the given proverb. However, it does not follow the specified format as it includes extra details outside of the 'tasks' list and incorrectly uses double quotes inside the JSON, which could lead to parsing errors. Additionally, the output does not directly answer the question as it states it cannot answer it but does not provide the complete steps required to answer the question using external aids.|FALSE|0.4|The actual output is a valid JSON object and includes the required keys: 'question', 'tasks', and 'can_i_answer'. However, the 'question' key's value includes unescaped double quotes, which is not valid JSON syntax and should use escaped characters or single quotes. Furthermore, although the 'tasks' key is present and is an array, and the 'can_i_answer' key is a boolean, the mistake in the 'question' value significantly impacts the validity of the JSON structure.|Malay
